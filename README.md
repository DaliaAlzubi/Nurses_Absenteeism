# Nurses_Absenteeism
Novel dataset for nurses from (KAUH)/Jordan, to predict the absenteeism of nurses.

We have built classification models using machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, the comparison showed that ANN is more efficient in our classification task, with an accuracy level of 82% than a nurse's classification, if she predicts absenteeism, the aim of this work is to help In predicting who among the nurses is expected to be absent in the coming year, especially in difficult times. Also, to give an explanation of the main factors that increase the probability of absenteeism, so as to help the hospital deal with such cases. Finally, the proposed model can be used by decision-makers as a new step to override the absenteeism rate and increase the level of health care service and production, which in turn gives optimal profits.
